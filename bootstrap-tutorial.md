# Bootstrap Tutorial

In this guide you will learn how to use BL4NK with Bootstrap in order to create responsive web design. A prerequisite is an installed version of Joomla!™ without content. The instructions are written so as you code it in practice, it is often switched back and forth. Only this way the individual steps are easy to understand and the learning effect remains high. The aim is to develop a finished device independent template under the use of Joomla!™ (clear), Bootstrap and SASS. Have fun!
