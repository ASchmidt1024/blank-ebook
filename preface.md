# Preface

When I published Blank end of 2011, I could not guess that it would be so often and quickly adopted. Within the next eighteen months it was downloaded about 100,000 times in 185 countries from the project page [http://blank.vc](http://blank.vc). What a success!

The BL4NK template project gives me an idea of what the Internet is and what it means to be in the community. Thanks to that community BL4NK is developing into something better than I originally planned for. At this point I would like to thank everybody for all the good tips and suggestions you gave me.

Thank you also for the many e-mails. I try to answer them all in the little spare time I have. However, you have to accept that my family do have priority.

BL4NK gives me the opportunity to give something back to the community.

Many thanks! Alex
