## Preface

When I published Blank end of 2011, I could not guess that it would be so often and quickly adopted. Within the next eighteen months it was downloaded about 100,000 times in 185 countries from the project page [http://blank.vc](http://blank.vc). What a success!

The BL4NK template project gives me an idea of what the Internet is and what it means to be in the community. Thanks to that community BL4NK is developing into something better than I originally planned for. At this point I would like to thank everybody for all the good tips and suggestions you gave me.

Thank you also for the many e-mails. I try to answer them all in the little spare time I have. However, you have to accept that my family do have priority.

BL4NK gives me the opportunity to give something back to the community.

Many thanks! Alex

## Author

Alexander Schmidt was born 1978. In 2000 during his studies in Heidelberg / Germany he found a program named 'FrontPage', which was supposed to create websites \(for aesthetic reasons we refrain from giving the company name here\). It was a very popular WYSIWYG editor. The program was quite successful, but Alexander realized very quickly that the real action happens behind the WYSIWYG editor.

At the time of writing Alexander is a lecturer at the Cooperative State University of Mannheim. For Franzis Verlag he wrote some books about Joomla templates, but he discovered that working alone is a much more better way for him to write and publish books.

## Introduction

This book is the advanced manual for BL4NK, the free template for Joomla! you can [download in current version at GitHub](https://github.com/Bloggerschmidt/Blank). This book describes in detail how the template works, from the very basic beginning up to advanced usage. Every single line will be discussed. It's the reference work to use on your own template projects.

Developing templates is an interdisciplinary exercise. In addition to your knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS you need some understanding of PHP, XML and Joomla's own code to successfully build a template. You don't have to be an expert in all those fields, though some knowledge in HTML and CSS are definitely required. The trick is to able to apply the above languages in a practical way.

Joomla is written in PHP \(PHP Hypertext PreProcessor\). In Blank you use this language together with the Joomla! API \(Application Programmer Interface\). Parameters extend the CMS capabilities. Using HTML and CSS we give form to the template. This can be extended by using LESS. Joomla works by default with the Bootstrap framework, which comes with the JavaScript library jQuery. JavaScript libraries are ideally suited for special effects on your website. For example, slideshows, animated drop-down menus or tabbed content. You don't need to know much about XML \(eXtended Markup Language\). If you know who to work with the templateDetails.xml files, that's pretty much all you need to know.

Software? To understand BL4NK you need an editor. Everything else is optional and up to your preference. I recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), available in a commercial and a trial version. Free alternatives are Notepad ++ \(Windows\), TextWrangler \(Mac OS\) or Gedit \(Linux\). Two add-ons to make your life easier: the Web Console in your browser and a code library \(for example snippets in Sublime Text\).

Are you in a hurry? In that case you can find a quick start into BL4NK in chapter "Getting Started". In the chapter "Blank" the template is described in detail. It is a read only section and ideal for reading leisurely on the couch. However, it wasn't written as entertaining evening reading. For this chapter, you should be wide awake and focused. Read it in your best hours.

A guide to port an existing template to Joomla 3 you can find in the "Upgrade" chapter. A "Bootstrap Tutorial" is also on board.

Still not deterred and eager on template design? Grab a cup of coffee and let's go!
